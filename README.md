## Key Insights

### Regional Preferences
- **Platforms**:
  - NA and EU had similar top platforms, favoring consoles like PlayStation and Xbox.
  - JP favored handheld devices, such as Nintendo platforms, over traditional consoles. I believe this is do to the popularity of public transportation in Japan.
- **Genres**:
  - Action and Shooter genres dominated in NA and EU.
  - JP favored Role-Playing games (RPGs).Anime is easily conveyed in games.

- Games rated "E" and "T" showed strong performance globally, but the impact of ratings varied by region.
- JP appeared less influenced by ESRB ratings compared to NA and EU.

### Hypothesis Testing
- The two-sample t-test revealed:
  - There is no significant difference in average user ratings between Action and Sports genres.
  - The average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are significantly different.
### Profitability of Genres
- Action and Shooter genres had the highest total sales globally.
- Genres with fewer games (e.g., Sports) showed higher average sales, indicating profitability per title.

## Final Thoughts
The results highlight the importance of regional and genre-specific marketing strategies for video game developers and publishers. Understanding regional preferences and user reviews can significantly impact sales and development priorities. I believe it would be a good idea to advertise mobile platform games such as pokemoon for nintendo DS in trains inside Japan.
